**hwk** tries to demonstrate how a modern Haskell based stream manipulation tool could look like.
It is similar to tools like **awk** or **sed**.
`hwk` allows compact command sequences that operate on a list of strings. Because Haskell is lazy and has most functions you'll ever need there is no need to invent another small DSL and hopefully
push people into using functional goodness. `hwk` also provides a method to store small functions for
reuse in environment variables.

## Example

```bash
# prepend a string to each line
seq 1 10 | hwk 'map ("number " ++)'

# sum all negative numbers.
eval $(hwk env ints 'map (\l -> read l :: Int)')
seq -100 100 \
  | hwk '\lines -> filter (0 >) $ ints lines' \
  | hwk '\lines -> [foldl (+) 0 $ ints lines]}'
```

The `hwk env` command loads the statement as `ints` function into the environment for later reuse.
The argument passed to `hwk` must be a valid Haskell statement.
It should always return a fucntion that takes takes a list of strings and returns a new list `[String] -> [String]`.

## Install

To install `hwk` locally you need [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) and
the [stack build tool](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade.html).
You can build the binary with stack or cabal.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lukasmartinelli/hwk
cd hwk
stack build

# or with cabal
cabal install
```

## What does `hwk` do?

- `hwk` will generate code and execute it under `runhaksell`
- `hwk` will try to lookup functions in the passed environment variables.
- `hwk` provides additional functions that help with converting streams

## What happens under the Hood?

The `hwk` code above can be translated directly into a valid Haskell program.

```haskell
ints = map (\l -> read l :: Int)
hwk = \lines -> filter (0 >) $ ints lines

main = do
    contents <- getContents
    mapM_ putStrLn $ map (\r -> show r) $ hwk $ lines contents
```

The second `hwk 'foldl (+) 0'` command will translate to.

```haskell
ints = map (\l -> read l :: Int)
hwk = \lines -> foldl (+) 0 $ ints lines

main = do
    contents <- getContents
    mapM_ putStrLn $ map (\r -> show r) $ hwk $ lines contents
```
